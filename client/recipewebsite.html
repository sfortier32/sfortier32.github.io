                <p><i>From the UMass Amherst CS 326: Web Programming July 2023 final project specifications:</i><br><br>
                    The objective of this project is to design and develop a single page web application that
                    links to an external site with a Node.js backend, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                    application should allow users to interact with it, perform CRUD operations, store data
                    using local storage, and store data in the back-end. The back-end should be implemented
                    in Node.js and communicate with the front-end using fetch. The project must utilize a database
                    (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) and include routes for all CRUD operations.

                <h2>Initial Development</h2>
                <p>With two weeks to create my first website, I began setting up a basic front-end and back-end. The initial
                    website wouldn't be visually complex, only displaying routed queries in text lists to ensure the back-end was functioning
                    correctly. Any designs implemented in HTML and CSS were not connected to the background until most buttons that the 
                    functions would need were created.

            <div class="para">
                <h2>Bulk of Coding & Challenges</h2>
                <p>Most of the time spent I spent coding was dedicated to the back-end of the data editor and creating a dynamic display. Much of
                    the code needed to be conditionally because there were multiple tables within my database. I also needed a separate form for 
                    each CRUD action, leaving me with 3 tables and nine forms to implement.<br><br>
                    The most challenging part came with updating existing data. I didn't want users to have to re-enter every field into an update 
                    form if they were only trying to change one field. So, I used PostgreSQL statements to pull data from empty fields to be pushed
                    into the update query, which are not to be confused will null entries that clean the field.

                <h2>Final Features</h2>
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Main Display</h3>
                <p>The main feature of the final web appliaction is a data display showing the three tables in our database: “Recipes”, “Ingredients”,
                    “Tags.” In selecting a different table, the respective contents will be displayed for the user to scroll through.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Data Editor</h3>
                <p>The database editor panel serves to integrate CRUD functionality into the user interface. It's a pop-up that allows users
                    to pick from the three tables and three actions: create, update, and delete. The editor is completely dynamic and will
                    display a success or failure message depending on whether a user has entered in values for all the required variables and
                    the fetch request processes smoothly.</p>

                <p>On the left side, users can access the generate-meals panel which attempts to rectify some of the difficulties
                    associated with meal planning in college age populations. Users can select a number of days from one to seven, and a few
                    predefined tags (“Cheap”, “Quick”, and “Bulk”) and subsequently generate a random selection of meals from the recipe
                    database which meet the tag criteria. Not selecting any of the tags will return recipes with any available tags and new
                    tags created by the user will not show up under the tags options on the side panel.

                <p>Every day, I found myself putting off tasks that I needed to do, only remembering when the day had already passed.
                    I wanted a way to keep track of these habits. Turning to the app store, many of the apps were cluttered with
                    features and locked simple functions behind paywalls.
                    <br><br>
                    I sought to create an app that would alleviate my problem, leeting users create a wide range of habits, sort them
                    into categories, and feel motivated to achieve their goals.

                <h2>Basic Features</h2>
                <p>The first couple weeks of the project were dedicated to creating a home page with a date carousel where the user
                    could perform CRUD interactions on habits. The habit model was originally developed using CoreData, but I was made
                    aware of SwiftData's recent release after a few days of work and rewrote the code. Since SwiftData is not very capable
                    when it comes to storing small quantities of data/variables, the habit model has become extensive, storing current streaks,
                    dates and their completion statuses, etcetera.

                <h2>Statistics & Motivation</h2>
                <p>Once the base actions were developed, I could begin deriving statistics from each habit. I developed a grid to display habits and
                    their current streaks which are calculated and updated once the statistics page is entered. There's also a weekly completion view
                    that shows a user's progress with colors that are tied to each habit status.
                    <br><br>
                    The visuals attempt to convince users to continue competing
                    habits by displaying negative colors when missed, reminding them of previously missed habits, and forcing them to consider the progress
                    they've already made.

                <h2>Final Details</h2>
                <p>After having completed the homepage, statistics page, and basic reset functions in the about page, I could focus on a few extra features
                    that would polish the app. I designed and implemented a timer that could be activated on any habit with a minutes unit, displays
                    confetti when finished, and has its progress halted and saved upon exiting. I then updated designs throughout the app to be more cohesive
                    and streamlined before finally adding in an achievements page.
                    <br><br>
                    I used Figma to design my own achievement badges which would be displayed within a new achievements page in the app. These unlockable icons
                    would futher reinforce habit completion and expand the ways in which the app appeals to a user's intrinsic reward system.

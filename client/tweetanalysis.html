          Throughout COMM 497DB: Survey of Digital Behavioral Data, students
          used natural language processing to explore social issues on a more
          individualized level, gathering and analyzing data from Twitter's API.
          <br /><br />
          We often discussed the emotional impacts of world events, reporting
          biases, and location, while acknowledging the production and
          consumption of misinformation and disinformation.

          Based on project guidelines, students were required to include a
          written component for to accompany the data that detailed the purpose
          and scope of the app, the type of data collected, key findings, and
          analytical limitations. While we were required to create an R Shiny
          application, where we had multiple pages, included radio panels, etc.
          were up to our discretion. Additionally, displaying more than one
          graph was preferred.

        <h2>Gathering Data</h2>
        <p>
          The project utilized Twitter's API to gather tweets using the the
          hashtag "NATO," which which subsequently pulled from the dates
          November 26, 2022 to November 30, 2022. My goal was to pick a somewhat
          pollarizing topic and put it into a social context while possibly
          revealing sentiments that aren't captured in official media.
          <br /><br />
          Gathering data proved to be challenging since many fields were
          optional for users, i.e. location which was needed to create the main
          map display. Subsequently, a set of 5,000 tweets provided by the API
          was condensed down to 97 viable ones with 48 variables each to
          analyze.
          <br /><br />
          The sentiment analysis was not dependent on having geocodes, so the
          entire dataset could be utilized. The package
          <code>syuzhet</code> provided a list of seniments and scores for each
          tweet. These were then aggregated by date and sentiment to produce our
          final dataset, each row being a date, feeling, and value between 0 and
          1 with 1 being strongest and 0 being weakest.

        <h2>Product & Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          I settled on creating a two-page app with the first page displaying
          the results of the geocode dataset and the second page focusing on the
          results of the sentiment analysis.
          <br /><br />
          The map page provides a visually pleasing interactive, with a radio
          panel that further emphasizes my written contributions through its
          focus on specific continents. I hoped to show users where discussion
          using #NATO were most prevelant, with the notion that an area is
          either affected by proximity to the issue (e.g., Europe) or political
          closeness (e.g., North America, Asia). The analysis was fairly strong
          in that regard. However, it could have been strengthened with further
          commentary on the contents of an area's tweets in a more specified
          sentiment analysis.
          <br /><br />
          The sentiment analysis had interesting results considering the
          variation present in the most overarching emotions (negative,
          positive). I attempted to explain these changes through unbiased,
          recent news, though it's worth exploring other variables since no
          topic can be fully explained by one event. I would further research
          cyclical changes in sentiment and how adjacent topics such as the
          publicity of a war and the number of countries impacted affect the
          strength of sentiment values on a daily basis.
